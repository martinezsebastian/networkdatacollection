Network data collection methods, in their most general form, can be divided into two modes: self-assessed connections and researcher-observed links. The former is based on self-reported peer networks, and the latter alludes to observable structures such as clusters of countries with trade treaties, but could also include social connections when observed through social media platforms, for example. Differences between these two methods translate into differences on how the networks are analysed. They make assumptions on how individuals connect to each other that differ both in theoretical references and consequent logical patterns; ergo, there exist practical implications to the results of the analyses. 

Self-assessed connections require surveyed nodes to think of the reach of their personal network and add weights accordingly - these can be thought of as subjective closeness or repeated social interactions (amount of time spent with the other). Measures of closeness rely heavily on node subjectivity, e.g. family, partners, admired local leaders; however time-type networs follow a logic in which behaviour (re: social learning and choices) is influenced by relevant (subjectively close) node behaviour and the most popular behaviour of the larger network, not unlike a DeGroot learning process. Researcher-observed links (of individuals) provide the opportunity to combine subjective and time-type networks through the construction of artificial weights that include some measure of subjective relevance and a count of social interactions in the observed network.

We propose a simulation which allows the same group of individuals to connect in different ways (i.e. conditional upon collection method). We explore the effect of the three resulting networks on Bayesian and DeGroot social learning outcomes. Each data collection method has its advantages (and limitations) depending on the researcher’s expected outcome. Self-asessed close relationships are ontological in nature and allow researchers to analyse network structures as every node perceives them. Moreover, they are practical when collecting survey (or field) data, because it requires the least amount of effort from a respondent. Self-assessed time-type networks tend to overlap with close relationships networks when, e.g. you spend a lot of time with your partner who is, subjectively relevant for your decision-making process. They differ, however, in that they include less relevant nodes (in terms of subjective closeness) with whom you interact constantly due to environmental circumstances (work, school) and which may carry a certain degree of external influence on beliefs either by reinforcing or challenging them. These networks tend to be more diverse and might exhibit a lesser degree of homophily. Researcher-observed network data collection is based on existing, easily observable structures. What is gained in independence from node-subjectivity bias, can be lost in the construction of weights that are too articial to reflect actual relevance for behavioural change (if not for information diffusion). 

The simulation is designed to highlight and compare the three network data collection methods. For the self-assessed closeness method, in which respondents determine connections based on their subjectively close(er) relationships, we define links as relationship-based connections; for the time-type self-assessed method, we define links as time-based connections. Each simulated individual has a ‘relationship’ variable and a ‘time’ variable, and the respective connections are based on distance to others on that same scale, plus a stochastic component to adjust for randomness. We sample the 'relationship' and 'time' variables from different distributions, allowing for different types of networks to be formed. An external, independent observer (Researcher henceforth) will determine connections as a mix between subjective closeness and repeated social interactions (based on our time variable). We propose a Cobb-Douglass type of function to determine these connections.
We create networks based on proximity of the 'relationship', 'time', and 'observable' scales. The networks are tested and analysed - the resulting network statistics are used to answer a set of questions, sampled from well-known network experiments including topics suc as social learning and belief formation, behavioural change and network-based choices. Results suggest that, Researcher-observed and time-type networks’ results approximate to each other with possible convergence. We conclude that, given the relative objectivity of these two, they may prove to be more relevant network collection methods to analyse social phenomena.  

NOTES: Sebastian, creo que valdría la pena clarificar/definir el tipo de escala que usan las variables de tiempo y relación. No me queda muy claro y juegan un papel importante en el análisis. Es una misma escala (comparable, o cómo?)
- Hice una pequeña simulación y parece funcionar bien en principio, pero necesito más tiempo para considerar las diferentes maneras en las que se pueden hacer las conexiones. Agregué un par de frases en el texto para que quede más detallado. 

Por otro lado, Al principio dices que hacemos(haremos) un análisis usando Bayesian learning outcomes (yo le agregué el DeGroot, que en Chandreskhar et al, 2016,se demostró tener mayor potencial predictivo de network behaviour) y luego que intentaremos responder diferentes preguntas usando diferentes metodologías. 
Creo que:
a) estaríamos abarcando mucho tema y;
- De acuerdo. Quité lo de las diferentes metodologías al final. Sólo estaba flotando ideas a ver qué podría funcionar.

b) no me queda del todo claro qué es lo que hacemos con lo cual no lo pude ree-escribir. 
- Creo que quedó más claro como está escrito ahora. Está abierto para que podamos trabajar en eso mientras escribimos el paper.

Creé este nuevo documento porque la diferencia entre tu abstract y este es muy grande, por si quieres comparar los dos y si borré algo relevante lo puedas recuperar. Avísame cuando revises esta versión y si quieres hacerle cambios (y si  quieres que edite para que quede con el mismo estilo de redacción).
- Gracias
