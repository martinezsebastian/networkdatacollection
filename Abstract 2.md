Network data collection methods, in their most general form, can be divided into two categories: self-assessed connections and researcher-observed links. The former is based on self-reported peer networks, and the latter alludes to observable structures such as clusters of countries, but could also include human connections when observed through social media platforms, for example. These two methods make different assumptions about the way individuals connect with each other; there exist practical implications to the results thrown from these analyses.

Self-assessed connections require surveyed nodes to think of the reach of their personal network, and can be thought of as subjective closeness or repeated social interactions. Measures of closeness rely heavily on node subjectivity, e.g. family, partners, admired local leaders; however time-type networks follow a logic in which behaviour (re: social learning and choices) is influenced by relevant -subjectively close- node behaviour and the most popular behaviour of the larger network, not unlike a DeGroot learning process. Researcher-observed links (of individuals) provide the opportunity to combine subjective and time-type networks through the construction of artificial weights that include some measure of subjective relevance and a count of social interactions in the observed network.

Each data collection method has its advantages depending on the researcher’s expected outcome. Self-assessed close relationships are ontological in nature and allow researchers to analyse network structures as every node perceives them. They are practical when collecting survey (or field) data because of the reduced efforts from respondents. Self-assessed time-type networks might overlap with close relationships networks when, e.g. you spend a lot of time with your partner. They differ, however, in that they may include less relevant nodes -in terms of subjective closeness- with whom you interact constantly due to environmental circumstances (work, school) and which carry a certain degree of external influence on beliefs either by reinforcing or challenging them. These networks tend to be more diverse and might exhibit a lesser degree of homophily. Researcher-observed network data collection is based on existing, easily observable structures. What is gained in independence from node-subjectivity bias can be lost in the construction of weights that are too artificial to reflect actual relevance for behavioural change, if not for information diffusion. 

We propose a simulation that allows the same group of individuals to connect in different ways. The simulation is an attempt to understand the extent data gathered in one context fits into another. For the self-assessed closeness method, we define links as relationship-based connections; for the time-type self-assessed method, we define links as time-based connections. Each simulated individual has a ‘relationship’ variable and a ‘time’ variable, and the respective connections are based on distance to others on that same scale, plus a stochastic component to adjust for randomness. We sample these variables from different distributions, allowing for different types of networks to emerge. An external, independent observer will determine connections as a mix between subjective closeness and repeated social interactions (based on our time variable). We use a Cobb-Douglass type of function to determine these connections.

We create networks based on proximity of the 'relationship', 'time', and 'observable' scales. The resulting network statistics are used to answer a set of questions to include topics such as social learning and belief formation, behavioural change and network-based choices. Results suggest that researcher-observed and time-type networks’ results approximate to each other with possible convergence. We conclude that given the relative objectivity of these two, they may prove to be more efficient network collection methods to analyse social phenomena when the context is not well known.
