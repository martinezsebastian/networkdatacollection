# Network Data Collection
Traditional network data collection methods can be generally divided in two modes: self-assessed and observational. Differences (logistical, practical, and theoretical) between these two translate into differences on how the networks can be analysed - they make different assumptions on how individuals connect to each other. The self-assessed mode can be further divided into two additional ways to ask survey-respondents for their close connections: their close relationships, and the people they spend time with. The observational mode is considered a combination of these two self-assessed modes. We propose a simulation which allows the same group of individuals to connect in different ways. We explore the effect of the three different network representation modes on bayesian social learning outcomes. 
Each one of the three methods have advantages depending on the expected outcome from the researchers. Self-assessment of relationships show [THIS IS WHAT RELATIONSHIPS SHOW]. Self-assessment of time shows that [WHAT DOES TIME SHOW]. Observational data collection is based on existing data structures, what is gained in independence from individual bias, can be lost in a more accurate version of type of connection which might affect an individual's actions.
